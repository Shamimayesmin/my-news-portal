                <h2>1.Difference between Var let and const</h2>
                <p class="fs-4">The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in    JavaScript include:
                    Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                    Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                    Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.</p>

                <h2>2.What is the difference between arrow function and regular function</h2>
                <p class="fs-4">The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.

                    const square = a => a * a;
                    
                    // Equivalent regular function
                    function square(a) {
                      return a * a;
                    }</p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    In regular function, this value is dynamic, In arrow function it equals to this of the outer function.

                    In regular function, arguments will give you list of parameter passed in function, In arrow function arguments is not defined.

                    In regular function, you always have to return any value, but in Arrow function you can skip return keyword and write in single line.

                    In arrow function parameters should be unique.

                    Hoisting matters in arrow function as function get not be invoked before initialisations.

                <h2>3.What is the difference betweent map, forEach ,filter and find</h2>
                <p class="fs-5">i.When to use forEach?
                    .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when you can’t use a more specialized tool.</p>
                    
                   <p class="fs-5"> ii.When to use map?
                    .map() when you want to transform elements in an array.</p>
                    
                  <p class="fs-5"> iii. When to use filter?
                    .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.</p>
                    
                 <p class="fs-5">  iv. When to use find?
                    .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.</p>
                    
                 <p class="fs-5"> v.  When to use reduce?
                    .reduce() when you want derive a single value from multiple elements in an array.</p>

                <h2>4. What is template string?
                </h2>
                <p class="fs-4">Template literals (template strings) allow you to use strings or embedded expressions in the form of a string. They are enclosed in backticks ``. For example,

                const name = 'Jack';
                console.log(`Hello ${name}!`); // Hello Jack!</p>
